#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.
#
#We'll learn more about lists in chapter 4.3, but you can
#change the items in the list just by following the same format:
#put strings in quotes, separate different items with commas.
#
#Write some code that will print True if the value of
#search_fruit is in the list, and False if it is not. For
#example, with the original values above, it would print True
#because "kiwi" is an item in the list. if we changed the value
#of search_fruit to "strawberry", it would print False.
