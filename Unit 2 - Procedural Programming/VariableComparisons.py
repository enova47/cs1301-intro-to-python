#When you submit your code, we'll test it with different
#values for mystery_value_1 and mystery_value_2 by
#overwriting the lines above. So, don't add any code before
#those two lines! However, you can change the two lines
#above to test your code with different values.

#Complete this program so that it prints True if
#mystery_value_2 is greater than or equal to mystery_value_1,
#and False otherwise.
#
#Hint: You can print the result of that comparison directly!


#Write your code here!
print(mystery_value_2 >= mystery_value_1)

#When you submit your code, we'll test it with multiple test
#cases, including some that are randomly-generated.
