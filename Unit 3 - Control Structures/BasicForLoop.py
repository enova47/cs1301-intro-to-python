#In the designated areas below, write the three for loops
#that are described. Do not change the print statements that
#are currently there.

print("First loop:")
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)

#Write a loop here that prints the numbers from 1 to 10,
#inclusive (meaning that it prints both 1 and 10, and all
#the numbers in between). Print each number on a separate
#line.


print("Second loop:")
for i in range(-5, 6):
    print(i)

#Write a loop here that prints the numbers from -5 to 5,
#inclusive. Print each number on a separate line.


print("Third loop:")
for i in range(2, 21, 2):
    print(i)

#Write a loop here that prints the even numbers only from 1
#to 20, inclusive. Print each number on a separate line.

#Hint: There are two ways to do this. You can use the syntax
#for the range() function shown in the multiple-choice
#problem above, or you can use a conditional with a modulus
#operator to determine whether or not to print.
