# Write a function called get_integer that takes as input one
# variable, my_var. If my_var can be converted to an integer,
# do so and return that integer. If my_var cannot be converted
# to an integer, return a message that says, "Cannot convert!"
#
# For example, for "5" as the value of my_var, get_integer would
# return the integer 5. If the value of my_var is the string
# "Boggle.", then get_integer would return a string with the
# value "Cannot convert!"
#
# Do not use any conditionals or the type() function.


# Write your function here!
def get_integer(my_var):
    try:
        return int(my_var)
    except:
        return "Cannot convert!"


# Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
# You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
# function with different inputs.
#
# If your function works correctly, this will originally
# print: 5, Cannot convert!, and 5.

print(get_integer("5"))
print(get_integer("Boggle."))
print(get_integer(5.1))
