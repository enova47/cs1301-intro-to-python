# We've written the function, reverse, below. This function
# takes a string and returns the reverse of it. There are two
# scope errors somewhere in the code. Read through all the
# code below to find and fix the errors, so that the function
# produces the correct output and the result of the function
# is correctly printed. Note that you should not change the
# three lines that are already present in the function, but
# you may add lines before them, or you may change or add to
# the lines outside the function.
#
# Note that your goal here is to fix both the function itself
# and the program as a whole. So, your function should be
# able to be called on a new string, and the program when
# run should print the reverse of the string originally on
# line 29.
