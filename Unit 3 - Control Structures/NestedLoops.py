#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#Above are three values. Run a while loop until all three
#values are less than or equal to 0. Every time you change
#the value of the three variables, print out their new values
#all on the same line, separated by single spaces. For
#example, if their values were 3, 4, and 5 respectively, your
#code would print:
#
#2 3 4
#1 2 3
#0 1 2
#-1 0 1
#-2 -1 0
