#We've learned a lot in this chapter. Let's try to use a lot
#of it for one final exercise.
#
#Write a function called sort_artists. sort_artists will
#take as input a list of tuples. Each tuple will have two
#items: the first item will be a string holding an artist's
#name, and the second will be an integer representing their
#total album sales (in millions).
#
#Return a tuple of two lists. The first list in the
#resulting tuple should be all the artists sorted
#alphabetically. The second list should be all the revenues
#sorted in descending numerical order.
#
#For example:
# artists = [("The Beatles", 270.8), ("Elvis Presley", 211.5), ("Michael Jackson", 183.9)]
# sort_artists(artists) -> (["Elvis Presley", "Michael Jackson", "The Beatles"], [270.8, 211.5, 183.9])
#
#Notice that artists is a list of tuples (brackets first,
#then parentheses), but sort_artists outputs a tuple of
#lists (parentheses first, then brackets).


#Write your function here!
def sort_artists(list1):
    artists = []
    sales = []
    for item in list1:
        artists.append(item[0])
        sales.append(item[1])
    artists.sort()
    sales.sort()
    sales.reverse()
    return (artists, sales)

#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.
#
#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print:
#(['Elvis Presley', 'Michael Jackson', 'The Beatles'], [270.8, 211.5, 183.9])
artists = [("The Beatles", 270.8), ("Elvis Presley", 211.5), ("Michael Jackson", 183.9)]
print(sort_artists(artists))
