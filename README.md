Completed Georgia Tech (GTx) Course: Introduction to Computing using Python

Course Content

This course is broken into five units:

    Unit 1: Computing. In this unit, we'll cover the basics of computing: what it means to write computer code, how to read computer code, and what it means to run and debug code.
    Unit 2: Procedural Programming. In this unit, we'll cover the basic paradigm of programming, procedural programming. In procedural programming, series of commands are executed in order. Here, we'll discuss variables, logical operators, and mathematical operators.
    Unit 3: Control Structures. In this unit, we'll cover control structures, which are lines of code that control when other lines of code run. We'll cover conditionals, loops, functions, and error handling.
    Unit 4: Data Structures. In this unit, we'll cover how data is structured to be operated upon by a computer. Specifically, we'll focus on structures that bring together multiple different pieces of data, like strings, lists, dictionaries, and file input and output.
    Unit 5: Advanced Topics. In this unit, we'll preview the next topics in computing: object-oriented programming and computer algorithms.
